	Allocation		Max		Available
              A B C D 		A B C D	              A B C D
P0     	0 0 1 2    		 0 0 1 2		1 5 2 0
P1     	1 0 0 0 			 1 7 5 0      
 P2  	1 3 5 4			 2 3 5 6
P3     	0 6 3 2 		               0 6 5 2
P4	0 0 1 4		  	 0 6 5 6

a.	What is the content of the matrix Need?
Need = Max – Allocation
		Need
A 	B 	C 	D
P0 	0 	0 	0 	0
P1 	0 	7 	5 	0
P2 	1 	0 	0 	2
P3 	0 	0 	2 	0
P4 	0 	6 	4 	2


b.	Is the system in a safe state? If so, determine the safe sequence.

The system above is in a safe state; the safe sequence is <P0, P1, P3, P4>.

c.	 If a request from P1 arrives for (0, 4, 2, 0) can the request be granted immediately? 
             Allocation		Max	  	Need      	   Available
              A B C D 		A B C D	               A B C D                 A B C D
P0     	0 0 1 2    		 0 0 1 2		  0 0 0 0                 1 5 2 0
P1     	1 0 0 0 			 1 7 5 0                 0 3 3 0
P2  	1 3 5 4			 2 3 5 6                 1 0 0 2
P3     	0 6 3 2 		               0 6 5 2                  0 0 2 0
P4	0 0 1 4		  	 0 6 5 6                   0 6 4 2 

Even after using the safety algorithm, the system is still in a safe state; thus, a request

may be granted, which could give a safe sequence of <P0, P2, P1, P3, P4>. 

2. Prove the Dekker algorithm satisfies all three requirements of the critical-section problem.

The algorithm satisfies all three requirements: 
a.	 Mutual Exclusion is ensured through the use of the flag and turn variables. If both of the 
processes set their flag to true, only the process whose turn it is will succeed, which will
	only cause one of the processes to succeed.  The waiting process can only enter its 
	critical section once the other process has updated the value of turn. 

b.	 Progress is also ensured through the use of the flag and turn variables. The algorithm
does not provide strict alternation; thus if a process wishes to enter into the critical 
	section, its flag variable must be set to true. When it comes out of the critical section, 
	its flag variable must be set to false and set turn to the value of the other process. If the 
             other process wishes to enter into the critical section, its flag variable must be set to 

              true. The process is repeated and the progress is ensured through the flag and turn 
              variables. 
c.	Bounded waiting is preserved through the use of the turn variable.  Consider a
situation where process 1 and process 2 both wish to enter into the critical 
	section:
		Even if both processes would set their flag variables to be true, it would
	not be possible for both processes to enter into the critical section; thus, one process
	would need to wait for the other process to complete before it could enter into 
	the critical section. If the bounded waiting requirement is not preserved, the waiting
	process would wait for indefinitely while the other process would enter into the critical
	section repeatedly. 
 
3.  Given five memory partitions of 100k, 500k, 200k, 300k, and 600k (in order), how would each of the First-fit, Best-fit, and Worst-fit algorithms place processes of 212k, 417k, 112k, and 412k (in order)? Which algorithm makes the most efficient use of memory (in this case)?

First-Fit:
212K is put in the 500k partition.
417K is put in the 600K partition.
112K is put in the 288K partition (500K – 212K).
412K must wait. 

Best-Fit: 
212K is put in the 300K partition. 
417K is put in the 600K partition.
112K is put in the 200K partition.
412K is put in the 500K partition. 

Worst-Fit: 
212K is put in the 600K partition.
417K is put in the 500K partition.
112K is put in the 388K partition(600K – 212K).
412K partition must wait 

In this case, the Best-fit algorithm makes the most efficient use of memory. 
4. Consider a paging system with the page table stored in memory:
 
i)	2(memory accesses) * 150ns = 300ns.
ii)	Effective memory access time: .8 * TLB hit-time + .25 * TLB miss-time = 
(.8 * 150ns)  + (.25 + 300ns) = 195ns.
5. Consider the following page reference string:
0, 1, 7, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 7, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 3
How many page faults would occur for the following page replacement algorithms?(Three 
frames are allocated to the process)
